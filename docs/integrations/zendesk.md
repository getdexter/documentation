Dexter uses the [Zendesk API] to integrate with Zendesk.

In order to setup the integration, you'll need the following data:

- Account name
- Agent email
- API Token

### Account name

You'll find the account name in the URL you use for Zendesk:

```
https://<account_name>.zendesk.com
```

### Agent email

The agent email is the same email you use to login to Zendesk.

### API Token

API tokens are managed in the Admin Center interface at Apps and integrations > APIs > Zendesk API. The page lets you view, add, or delete tokens.

[Zendesk API]: https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/
