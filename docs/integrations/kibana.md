Dexter uses the [Kibana API] to integrate with Kibana.

In order to setup the integration, you'll need an API key and the Kibana URL.

### API Key

You can create a _User API key_ (or _Personal API key_) from the Kibana UI: open the main menu, then click _Stack Management > Security > API Keys_.

See [API Keys](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/api-keys.html#create-api-key) for more information.

### Kibana URL

This is the URL you use to access Kibana.
